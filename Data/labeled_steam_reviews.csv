there is also the recurring events that can be good or bad and the game will only show you what youve chosen before.,0,
if you cant remember every single permutation that can arise from these choices it can get equally tedious.,0,

"The problem is no necessarily the random chance you get to obtain modifiers, rather it takes a lot of time to get into de mid-game, but then get a negative perk that sabotages the rest of the experience.",-1,balance

-Games are often at times decided on luck rather than skill,-1,balance
"It doesn't require a ton of focus so it's great for listening to podcasts, music, or just chatting with some friends.",1,relaxing
I do feel that the game does get repetitive and it's hard to keep playing after a long session because losing can get frustrating because you will have to completely restart after you lose.,-1,gameplay
I also feel that there's needs to be more things to do that involve strategy and less RNG and knowing what each thing does.,-1,balance
A lot (not all) of the game is around getting good events and knowing which choice to choose  because these events can be the difference between winning easily or losing horribly.,-1,balance
"On the other hand though, they also keep the game fresh and interesting and adds a benefit to those who have gone through all the questions to find the best answers.",1,gameplay
I think they could simply add something else to balance these events out so players don't feel cheated whenever they get a bad event.,-1,balance
"At the time of this review the second campaign came out with the addition of the ""raid"" mechanic and without actually being able to try it out yet, I can already say the devs are heading in the right direction withing adding new things to keep the game fresh, but I'm also concerned this will just bring more random outcomes into the game 

FINAL VERDICT:
If you're just looking for a simple management game or something to do while listen to music, I would recommend this game.",1,gameplay
It's simple and doesn't require a ton concentration and doesn't require a lot of time either.,0,
Anyone can simply open the game for maybe 5-10 minutes and just play a quick game.,0,
"On the other hand, if you're looking for a more complex game that requires a lot of thought put into it, where there's tons of choices to be made about how to do one thing to the next, then this probably isn't the game for you, YET.",0,
"The reason why I say yet is because even thought at the moment the game is extremely simple, it could easily become more complex as the devs add more and more to the game.",0,
I would suggest waiting a while until they add more to fit the more complex play style,0,

"It's permadeath, but there's no achievement perks or anything, so a failed run gives you experience on what option to click in the random events, and that's it.",0,

"It's permadeath, difficult, time consuming, repetitive, and attention demanding.",-1,gameplay
One of those elements has to go for this to be a game I'd recommend.,0,
"Great game with dark humor and subtle flawour of FTL )
Start is rather relaxing but after few levels you discover yourself juggling hundrets puny humans and dealing with bunch of really strange problems (like giant mutant baby eating your humans or smth)",1,humor
Graphics is awesome!,1,art
"Somewhat in the direction of FTL, but in a way that you only have to take care of four things in order to progress the game.",0,
"I played Despotism 3k on the mobile too, but I find it to be more difficult with the tiny screen on my device and without the mouse.",0,
Therefor I bought this game on Steam instead and tried it out.,0,
"So far, the game utilizes heavily on the RNG events, whether if it's a good one, a bad one or a mixed one.",-1,balance
"If you don't plan things accordingly, then it's a game over.",0,
"I failed multiple times, mostly because of the bad events happening which caused decent amount of problems to my power supply.",0,
And the power supply on this game is crucial to your survival.,0,
"Each day, your power supply needs more juice in it, making it difficult to upgrade things as you progress on.",0,
The art/pixel style on this game is gorgeous and simplistic.,1,art
Events you choose also has an interesting outcome to your room.,0,
when the air gets hot and you see the humans (and you on the screen) start to produce sweat.,0,
Soundtracks are also nice to listen.,1,sound
"Each segment (of the campaign) makes the soundtrack get more intense as you progress further, but it gets repetitive very fast, so you'd have to lower the volume at some point.",0,
"Its a fun little game, but almost all the damn events seem to have set outcomes for each choice, the game actually lags as the game goes on and once and a while, occasionally eats inputs, and has infuriating bugs here and there.",-1,balance
One of those damn bugs just cost me the best run I have had up until now because the portal to the bioreactor just stopped working and any humans I had sent were stuck doing nothing.,-1,bugs
"Graphics: 8/10
 The graphics are timless pixel art and convey a lot of what is going on in the game through simplicity and with humor.",1,art
It's absolutely hilairous watching the little humans go at it in the breeding tube.,1,humor
But mostly it's just one screen and that's all you'll be seeing for the entirety of the game minus graphical updates depending on what you experience in any given play through.,0,
"Controls: 7/10
Pretty much just the mouse aside from spacebar to pause.",1,controls
It's not bad but I would have loved being able to queue things up during pause or hotkey shortcuts to adding/removing humans from certain stations OR just hotkeys for upgrading stations.,0,
"Music:5/10
It's pretty much back-ground noise level which isn't bad to listen to.",1,sound

"Gameplay: 9.5/10
This is where Despotism shines the most I believe.",1,gameplay
"It is very challenging in its management of trying to control a large population of humans, keep your population up, keep them fed and producing enough energy that you can regularly upgrade the stations you need to upgrade to progress as smoothly as possible throughout the days.",1,balance
"The story for the game is entertaining, and the dialogue choices and options are humorous.",1,narrative
"Everything else aside, Gameplay Mechanics and Story/Dialogue are what kept me playing round after round of this game, no matter how salty I was when I'd get 7 days in and die because I upgraded at the wrong time.",1,narrative
"The only negative thing I can say about the gameplay is that it's possible to find a groove early on using just a handful of humans that can provide the power you need and once you hit that groove, there's very little incentive to keep leveling up past that especially when you're producing enough energy and humans that you can constantly sacrifice to the bioreactor to keep your power up.",0,
"On a last note, the random events at the end of each day keep the game fresh and the replayability high.",1,balance
"Overall Game Rating: 8/10
For the price tag of 8 bucks, and the high replayability and challenge of the game, this game is absolutely worth buying at full price and DEFINITELY worth buying at any discount during a sale or promotion.",1,price
"It's an absolutely wonderful little time sink of a game that also happens to be good if you wanna sink some real hours into it as well but prepared for a challenge, getting the hang of where things should be at any given time isn't easily mastered.",0,

"There is an optimal way to play, a precise strategy you HAVE to follow, combined with luck on events and that is it.",0,
"Nearly every decision has an optimal path to pick and often which that is, is impossible to actually tell in advance.",0,
"The only way to actually complete the game is to either play over and over and over again(using the same precise optimal build order every time), or, well... do that and also get lucky so as to not be screwed on random events?",0,
"You could also literally take notes on the outcome of every event until you know what the optimal chocie is every time, gee, that sure is fun!",0,
"I don't mean notes in the game, I mean actually write them down yourself.",0,
"Also, assuming you don't pause at all it is literally impossible to complete the game in less than 42 minutes due to the way the timer works, so you will have to keep trying a 42 minute session over and over and over and over and over(and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over) until you get lucky.",0,
There is no strategy and no choice here.,-1,balance
"So, I have to give it a negative review.",0,
"It has a strong start, until you realize the above, then the game is bland and boring and the humor wears thin after you see the same jokes 20 times.",-1,humor
A lot of the management options are fairly simple.,0,
"Figure out what to upgrade when and bam, the core of the game has been completed.",0,
"This, however, doesn't mean you'll win.",0,
"You'll have to go through these absurd, arbitrary events who almost all have some options which for no real reason will permanently handicap your game and literally cause you to lose.",0,
"So in order to win this game, the primary thing you should do is to memorize all of these absolute absurd events and what the effects of the different choices are, not actually think strategically about your management of the humans.",-1,gameplay
I can't stress how frustrating this is.,-1,fun
"When I play a small game like this I just want to unwind, not get kicked in-between my legs for not realizing that spending 1680~ energy instead of 800~ energy will cause my humans to die at random when carried around and give no benefits what-so-ever.",0,

"This game is a mix of Cookie Clicker and resource management, with punishing resource management.",0,
"The ""events"" in game are so ludicrous and nonsensical, which at first is whimsical, until you realize you are badly losing games due to these events, cause you to re-play the first boring ten minutes over and over until you figure out all the events (or look them up).",-1,balance
"The actual mechanics are at first interesting, but then quickly become frustrating and punishing as upgrading things out of order can sometimes make you lose the game entirely.",-1,gameplay
"I get that that's the point, but it's still a frustrating mechanic.",0,
"If there was a chance to rewind the game a minute or so after major mistakes, it'd be more interesting.",0,
"By the time I beat the first campaign and moved to the second (about 6 hours), I'd already completely lost interest in the mechanics.",0,
"There's nearly no replayability, even with the different avatars I've unlocked.",-1,gameplay
It's literally impossible to get enough energy.,0,

Rather alright for a few hours of entertainment.,1,playtime
The game is not really about management and exploring what strategies work better or worse.,0,
You will soon realize that there's one very specific order and path you need to push development in.,0,

There's a random event each day and you will soon learn most of the events and which option is the correct one to choose.,-1,balance

"I just had a good run with the basic strategy being: process as many humans as possible in the bioreactor (basically the longer you play this is what you're doing the whole time, frantically clicking this button to stay alive because anything else will death spiral you, which by the way makes the game very unenjoyable because you can't breath just frantically clicking things) and the boom, RNG hit me with a negative 50 percent bioreactor speed.",0,
"Everything else was maxed as far as it could be for the energy cap and this event alone killed me because every tick it takes more energy, your energy levels are capped based on the day so you can't upgrade when you have the energy to do it and when you finally get the capped raised so one little RNG and boom it's goodnight because you literally cannot get enough energy to upgrade anything anymore no matter what you do.",0,
It had nothing to do with how I was playing and everything to do with one game killer RNG.,-1,balance

"Power management is painful because there's no indication how much each piece of equipment uses, or how much more it'll need when you upgrade it.",-1,balance
"The way electricity works is also a bit weird, because rather than having to carefully balance the needs of your equipment with how much power you produce, instead it's an annoying waiting game that can easily turn into a negative feedback loop if you get the wrong event.",0,
"Human management is painful because it feels like unless you get one of the events that gives the humans more endurance ( the blue skin one, for example ) you have to spend so much time trying to manage their exhaustion you don't get any time to meaningfully think about your next steps.",-1,balance

"When the game seems to be tuned to force you to send people on missions almost immeidately, despite not having the humans to spare -- that's kind of when this whole tower of cards finally falls apart.",0,
You need to send humans on a scouting mission because you otherwise will be constantly low on everything; but sending enough humans to have a chance at success puts you either in or dangerously close to a negative feedback loop.,0,
Add in a random event that could kill a few more humans and now it's time to start the game over.,-1,balance
The difficulty has either been so tightly tuned that it's mostly just frustrating -- or the game wasn't really tuned at all.,-1,balance
"The small margin for error means you've got practically no wiggle room for mistakes, but even playing perfectly you can still lose because a random event wipes out too many humans for you to recover from.",0,

You do unlock an easy mode after 3 losses so there's that but there are challenges that I don't think you can do on the easy difficulty so a lot of they replayability is locked to the extreme randomness.,-1,balance

The game has oodles of character and dig the look.,0,
The whole premise initially keeps you entertained but as you play through the first few levels you begin to realize there really is only one way to play and need to memorize the exact order to do it in.,0,
Random events while cool initially devolve into having to restart the game when it gives you a bad negative event.,-1,balance
They ask the same questions so its only a matter of picking the right choice (which at that point why bother including them?),0,
Frequently if you do the build order wrong or dont keep up with the power levels you get into an unwinnable state as you cant produce enough power.,0,
The game quickly loses what little enjoyment you have when it only lets you play one way.,-1,fun

The problem is that it doesn't really accomodate for multiple play styles - when you beat it once you'd basically be doing the exact same thing.,-1,art

"As Gris journeys through the various dream-like environments, she will gain new abilities that aid her in solving puzzles and navigating difficult terrain, returning colour to the monochromatic world as she travels through it.",0,
"In terms of gameplay and mechanics, GRIS is very light on its feet.",1,gameplay
There is no fail state and there are no enemies to overcome; this is a game to be experienced rather than one that is to be beaten into submission.,0,
"The game deftly handles themes of grief, depression, and ultimately acceptance with a level of maturity and emotional depth that is both rare and tangible, and it does so without ever uttering a single word of dialogue.",0,
"GRIS is brought to life by painstakingly hand-drawn animations and a dynamic musical score that swells with pivotal gameplay and story moments, which culminates in a game that is often profoundly moving, achingly beautiful, and starkly relatable to anyone who has suffered any form of life-altering emotional trauma.",1,art

What I really love about modern indie games is that they can be extremely emotional and tell you amazing stories without a single word.,0,
This kind of games changed a lot for the past few years and went to a whole new level.,0,
They helped us to understand that the experience and emotions that you feel through the game are the most significant things.,0,

Gris tells us a story of a young girl, who is trapped in her own dull world full of desperation, pain, and sorrow.",0,

"During her journey, she discovers different abilities that greatly help her in overcoming varying obstacles.",0,
"[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

In Gris, the player doesn't have to think about the final destination at all.",0,
This game is more about the experience and feelings and this is what makes it so beautiful.,1,atmosphere
"It's all about the beautiful journey, where the player has to jump from one platform to another, enjoying beautifully drawn watercolor landscapes.",1,art
"It's important to state, that Gris is a very relaxing and meditative game, where the game leads you by the hand most of the time, so you can just lay back in your comfortable chair and enjoy this little masterpiece.",1,atmosphere
"Gris starts her journey in a dull grey world and every time she progresses through the story and unlocks another ability, the surroundings around her getting filled with colors and the player gets the corresponding achievement.",0,
"In general, she has to gather twinkle little stars and bring them to the special place where they gather into the constellation making a bridge for Gris.",0,
"On top of that, Gris also tries to implement puzzle mechanics in the game and they work very well in there.",1,puzzles
These puzzles are pretty casual and their main goal is to dilute the overall gaming experience a little bit.,1,puzzles
That young girl discovers different abilities through the journey and they become pretty handy while solving these puzzles.,1,puzzles
Every single ability is connected to the level where Gris is located right now.,1,narrative
"That means that if Gris is located somewhere where you can see cracked stones laying around, then you will get an ability to crack them pretty soon.",0,
"If you see an obstacle which is too far away from you and you can't get there with your regular jump, then you will get the double jump ability now.",0,
"Some of these puzzles can be a bit frustrating, but most of the time they are pretty simple and intuitive.",-1,puzzles
"Speaking of locations and the variety of them, I can say that developers did their best to bring as many diverse locations as possible.",1,level design
Keeping in mind that this game is pretty short this is a great achievement.,1,playtime
"You will have the ability to travel through the devastated desert, enchanted forest, black and white empty world, underwater kingdom with its habitats and many more.",0,
There is no combat in this game at all and no boss fights.,1,gameplay
"Sometimes, Gris encounters an enemy, who starts to chase her for a small period of time.",0,
"In fact, it is just a huge enemy like a black bird or underwater creature, who makes your way to the objective a little bit harder.",0,
"You can't die during these events or stuck for hours, it's just a quick short scene, aimed to add a little bit more action to this meditative relaxing game.",0,
"Gris is an extremely short game, which can be completed in one session, maximum two if you don't rush.",1,playtime
"For me personally, it took a bit more than three hours to finish this beautiful game.",1,playtime

"The whole animation thing and visual effects are very impressive, and every single screenshot you take in this game can be put in a frame and used as a postcard or something like that.",1,art
"[h1] Sound [/h1]

Sound effects are another thing that will blow your mind away.",1,sound
It’s very emotive and perfectly fits its dramatic atmosphere with the mild sounds of violin and disturbing piano sounds during the most tragic moments.,1,sound
"From time to time, Gris shows her vocal skills which make every single plant blossom and this is something absolutely beautiful and incredible.",1,sound
"Also, I really enjoy how they implemented some sound effects, where certain sounds disappear and then appear back again during the natural circumstances.",1,sound
It is absolutely brilliant and adds a strong feeling of realism for sure.,0,

Probably worth waiting for a sale for most people.,-1,price

I had to turn off my gamer brain for this game because I found it pretty bad every time I turned it on.,-1,gameplay

"[h1]Pictures at an Exhibition[/h1]

One thing that can be consistently heard about [i][b]GRIS[/b][/i] is that the game is pure art.",1,art
But what does that actually mean?,0,
"Certainly the first thing that impresses upon you is an exquisite hand-drawn minimalistic and stylised art reminiscent of 70s sci-fi comics, like Mœbius, with a bit of Golden Age of Illustration and Art Nouveau touch.",1,art
"Hailed as a feat of visual storytelling graciously helped by a memorable and imposing soundtrack, there's no denying that GRIS is an absolute audio-visual delight in game form.",1,art
"It's been called an interactive animated movie which, turns out, is a cause for praise and derision alike.",1,art
It's certainly not every day you encounter a game that lets its [b]visual art[/b] be the star.,0,
"Sure, there are many beautiful looking games, but visuals are usually in service of the story, gameplay or showcasing latest technology.",1,art
"In GRIS, it's literally the main character, the point, the first thing around everything else is created.",0,
"The whole game can be seen as a showcase, an exhibition you're waltzing through while admiring pictures.",1,art
"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776833982 

This is most evident in the elemental level design, the idea to start with an almost blank canvas, a simple black and white drawing, a sketch, and slowly add colours to it, bringing it to life, ending with a lush, flourishing, vibrant world that is a total feast for the eyes.",1,level design
"This is basically a creative painting process at the very core of the game, which then dictates every facet of it.",0,
And that's what GRIS is: a watercolour painting come alive as you dance through it.,1,art
I don't have a problem with that.,0,
"To me, it's as valid a choice as any to build a game around.",0,
"If we can have completely narrative games where storytelling art is front and center, then why not visual art.",1,narrative
Telling a story wordlessly through visual and audio means of expression is very appealing to me.,1,narrative
"But, it would've also worked if they hadn't been used in service of storytelling, but let loose in all their associative and abstract glory to paint the canvas with sensory overload.",1,narrative
I believe GRIS didn't need to tell some vague sob story at all.,0,
This [b]story[/b] about loss and going through five stages of grief is the weakest part of it.,0,
The way it's expressed is too vague to be really impactful and yet not ambiguous enough to be less obvious.,0,
"Visual metaphors and symbolism are blatant and too transparent, associations very surface-level: red is for anger, blue is sad, bell is salvation, dark caverns for depression, there's even a black bird and eel representing inner demons and fears etc.",1,narrative
"Her whole world is broken, literally, as seen in all the architectural ruins and cracks on numerous mind palaces.",0,
The structure of her being has collapsed and needs to be rebuilt.,0,
"But the way this rebuilding is achieved, through bringing colours to the grey world, strikes me as superficial paint job that just masks the cracks.",0,
"Sadly, the game didn't actually pose this question and this metaphorical story didn't do much to tickle my imagination.",-1,narrative
"From the architecture and landscape to the girl's reduced stick figure, everything is graceful and elegant, light and tender, airy and weightless, floaty, silky... thin... insubstantial.",1,atmosphere
"Such a minimalistic and delicate, highly lyrical style is perfect for expressing fragility, but has a hard time depicting darker, heavier sides of pain and agony... not to mention uglier.",1,art
"Gentle, translucent pastels sprawling over the 2D plane also have that neat and smooth quality; and even though the colours are spilling and (over)flowing, it's a controlled and choreographed movement.",1,art
There's no messiness and chaos here and yet we're supposed to be undertaking the emotional journey through a grief-stricken soul.,0,
But there's one element that complements the visuals and perfectly jumps in to fill the void left by them - [b]music[/b].,1,sound
"Vast empty spaces composed with just a few elements are filled with monumental music, which is at its most grand when a new colour appears.",1,sound
"There's synesthesia at work here; as you unlock a colour, new music piece forms which also helps establish an emotional progression through the game.",1,atmosphere
"First there's a simple melody with a few instruments, then as colours unlock, composition becomes longer, richer, denser, full orchestra at the end and a regained voice.",1,gameplay
"It's a very effective, if predictable, manipulation, going from sad and depressed to uplifting and cathartic.",0,
It wouldn't surprise me that people cry here without really knowing why.,0,
"Simply put, it's all in the service of specific aesthetic which takes the center stage.",0,
GRIS is dedicated to being beautiful.,1,art
It wants to be pretty and attractive at all times... and accessible to all.,0,
And that is perfectly reflected in the [b]gameplay[/b] as well.,1,gameplay
"This is a side-scrolling platformer, stripped-down and simplistic by platforming standards, careful not to overshadow the beautiful picture and suffocate the flow.",1,gameplay
It's designed to appeal to a broad audience.,0,
"There's no dying, no real danger of failure.",0,
"Developers were deliberately trying to avoid one feeling - frustration... so that you could feel all the pretty emotions, not ugly, not even depression which is represented with dark colours, deep in underground tunnels, and yet everything is still sparkly and glittery.",0,
"The game is chill and relaxed, wants you to look at her and marvel at the scenery.",1,relaxing
"I was actually ok with this easier and casual gameplay, and not just because I'm a bit rusty with platformers, but because there's one thing in it that completes this magical sounded picture - movement.",1,relaxing
"Everything has a smooth flow and fluidity, platforming feels like dancing.",0,
"To me, GRIS is [b]ballet[/b].",0,
"There's only a forward moving drive though, with some tangents for collectables which are the most challenging parts of the gameplay, but tend to break the established rhythm.",1,balance
"Otherwise, you can't go back, you're basically locked from ever being lost.",0,
Not letting you feel lost and anxious in a game about overcoming pain is making those emotional beats the music was trying its hardest to achieve feel artificial and undermined.,1,atmosphere
"There [i]are[/i] dramatic, tense moments, almost completely automated and yet they still feel exciting riding on audio-visual bonanza alone.",1,atmosphere
Last level is such a culmination in artistic and gameplay sense that I can just call it heavenly.,0,
"Dramatic zooming in and out, sudden falls and cathartic soarings, changing dress shape with new abilities and crisp sound effects (heavy cube with a thud, diving with a cute pop, fluttering with double jump) and finally a life-giving song - it feels so good and pleasant to play in this world.",1,atmosphere
It's enchanting and bewitching... even if it doesn't really have anything meaningful to say.,0,
I just wish it didn't pretend it had.,0,
It works best when it's all about the simple pleasure.,0,
"I don't really see it as a narrative game per se, but I enjoyed it as a full sensory spectacle.",0,
It wasn't so much an emotional journey for me but an 'indulging my eyes and ears' one.,1,atmosphere
As an appreciator of visual arts I let it seduce me even though it didn't quite manage to deceive me.,-1,art
It's artistically stylish and awash in watercolours with imagery more akin to be likely discoverable in an art gallery than in a PC game.,1,art
In that regard [b][i]GRIS[/i][/b] puts forward a strong case for the games as art debate.,1,art
I took so many screenshots of this game because around every corner and in every and nook and cranny there was something gorgeous to capture.,1,art
"is not a particularly resource heavy game, it is also available on IOS which should already indicate it will run fine on most systems, even low end ones.",1,optimization
I didn't encounter any issues while playing the game either so I cannot fault the game for anything here.,0,
I love puzzle solving and I love platformers which is why I bought this game immediately on release.,1,puzzles
It has moments of serenity followed by big loud orchestral pieces that complement the more tumultuous sections of the game.,1,sound
"The soundtrack is in a constant crescendo and its absolutely haunting to listen too, even when not accompanied by the games intense visuals.",1,sound
The soundtrack is composed by a group called Berlinist based in Barcelona and they quite frankly did an incredibly impressive job here.,1,sound
"Not once during my playtime of the game did, I feel that it was dragging or that I was bored and wanted it to be over.",-1,fun
My only complaint as a seasoned puzzle and platforming veteran is that I found the majority of the game a bit too simplistic and would have enjoyed a bit more of a challenge.,-1,gameplay
"Where [b][i]GRIS[/i][/b] really excels is in its glorious visuals and heartfelt indirect storytelling, which I find I am enjoying more and more of these days rather than having it spelt out for me.",1,art
[b][i]GRIS[/i][/b] deserves the praise and the Bafta Award nominations it received and I really look forward to seeing what Nomada Studios present us with next.,1,art
GRIS is not a traditional video game.,0,
Its an interactive artpiece with stunning artwork and mesmerizing soundtrack.,1,art
There are gameplay which revolves around 2D platforming with some light puzzle sections.,1,gameplay
It is not a combat focused game nor is it a heavy on the platforming.,0,
Its an excuse to enjoy a very elaborate interactive piece of collage or a painting trying to figure out its meaning and what the art is trying to express.,0,
"This game is at its core, an artist's expression of his / her art and thoughts in video game form.",0,
The game will last you about 3-4 hours depending on your playstyle.,1,playtime
It doesn't overstay its welcome.,0,
"Overall, I rate GRIS a 9/10 simply because of its unique artstyle and soundtrack.",1,art
It's one of the best piece of art i've ever played.,1,art
Feel free to follow my review page!,0,
Gris is a very short artistic platformer about a girls journey through hardship and overcoming difficulties by eventually accepting life as it is.,1,art
"👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Beautiful art style.",1,art
"👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Short and easy.",-1,playtime
"-The ""story"" or the journey relies heavily on the player being personally invested.",-1,narrative
"[h1]Story[/h1]
Gris has no actual story per se, but more of a girls journey through what I'm assuming is some form of depression/sadness in her life and conquering it.",1,narrative
"Honestly, I could not relate to her or the obtuse way of telling her story/journey and as such, I was not that emotionally attached to it.",0,
"I understand the way the developers chose to transform a simple story of sadness and [spoiler]loss[/spoiler] in art, is quite nice but it's something we have seen many other times.",0,
I can agree that many players will find themselves in this journey and may get very attached to it however personally I felt nothing at the end.,0,
Maybe I would need to experience what the girl in the game has gone through to understand or maybe I've experienced it in so many other mediums that I no longer am so easily impressed.,0,
Story rating: 7/10,1,narrative
"[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game is basically a platformer, going through very pretty landscapes, collecting little light thingies that ultimately help you progress to the end of the journey.",1,gameplay
It's the most basic of platformers with almost no difficulty whatsoever and at times you may be required to do some small platforming puzzles.,0,
"There are also some collectibles or mementos as they're called, to be found which sadly are missable until you finish the game, so make sure if you want to do 100% before the end, pay very close attention to the environment.",0,
Gameplay rating:  7/10,1,gameplay
"[h1]Audio[/h1]
The soundtrack is something I very much enjoyed.",1,sound
It fits perfectly with the art style and overall tone of the game.,0,
"There is no voice acting besides the singing, if that counts, and the sound effects are all pretty standard as expected.",1,sound
Audio rating:  8/10,1,sound
"[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
As I've mentioned before this is an artistic game, and as such the main focus will be how the game conveys its message or journey through art.",1,art
I was quite impressed by how beautiful the game can look in its minimalistic style.,1,art
"The use of colors changing as the girl starts to ""recover"" is well done.",1,art
There were no bugs in my entire playthrough and the game runs perfectly smooth.,1,optimization
"Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8.5/10",1,art
"[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I honestly think the developers did what they set out to do with Gris quite well.",0,
"Perhaps I am a more hardened person than the usual joe and as such I could not get emotional regarding the journey however I do appreciate what has been made here, and the art style and music certainly make the game a  decent purchase, though far from what most Steam users are calling this a ""masterpiece"".",0,
[h1]Final score: 7.62/10[/h1],0,

Incredible artistic achievement.,1,art
I love how simple this game/toy is in it's design for how effective it was at being able to build what I had imagined.,1,fun

To everyone involved in creating this delightful little program: thank you.,0,
ADD LITTLE PEOPLE!!!!!!,0,

Just wanted to say thanks for the full controller support.,1,controls
its always the 5 dollar indie game that changes your life,1,price
forgot i had depression for a second,0,
"Townscaper while not a game, is the perfect tool for creating cities and towns for pictures and other useful activities.",0,
I personally use it for Dungeon Mastering and creating a comprehensive city layout that I can then detail in separate tools.,0,
The 3D aspect of creating a town is the most useful by far.,0,
"Excellent, meditative and very relaxing in a strange way.",1,relaxing
"Perhaps the addition of some more live elements (such as people, boats etc) and the ability to designate buildings or areas to certain categories such as market, church, house might improve the experience?",0,
I love it anyway and look forward to seeing what future updates provide.,0,
"Some people have criticised this game because of its lack of objectives, they say it's not a real game because you can never win or lose.",0,
This programme is so much more than a game.,0,
"A form of expression, even a form of therapy.",1,relaxing
"The finely balanced combination of design and necessity, having your ""perfect"" building turn out different to how you expected, you fix it and it somehow ends up looking better then your original plan.",1,gameplay
"Now it needs a neighbourhood, several hours pass and you declare your work done, not because you are bored but because a true artist knows when a work is finished.",0,
This game is sublime because it makes me feel like a true artist.,0,
What a pleasant surprise.,0,
"Properly creative, satisfying, visually appealing, well made, well priced, and well dressed.",1,atmosphere

"I struggle in some kinds of sandbox games to muster up the energy to create something beautiful, and usually that process consists 95% of hating my life then 5% satisfaction at the final product.",0,
This game has flipped that on it's head and makes the entire process satisfyingly pleasing.,0,
I'm having so much fun exploring what's possible in this fun little game.,0,
"It will be an amaging engineering challenge and it will allow us to enjoy mini-games, like flying a toy plane or parkouring Journey-style, in those tiny worlds we make.",0,
A new paradigm on level design is upon us.,1,level design
Why not instead of an infinite expanse of water have a procedurally generated planet that one could build on.,0,
Maybe there are some people that would prefer it the way it is and that could be toggled on and off whichever way the player prefers to play.,0,
These are some of the ideas that I notice and can't help but feel like the true potential of this game is barely being scratched.,0,
Vey good satisfying game.,1,relaxing

"I know you've already got a library full of stuff you don't play - you'll play this, don't worry.",0,
"The developer calls this more of a toy or experiment than a game and he is correct - this however does not impact the magic and wonder this very simple little procedural town builder (or painter, or creator - Im not sure what to call it) can create.",0,
The minimalist mechanics and intuitive design is amazing and what you can get out of something that on the surfaces seems so simple is a testament to how deeply creative this little game really is.,1,gameplay

"Anyway, great game, I love playing while listening to podcasts (i'm listening to Father Mike Schmitz bible in a year podcast while playing so it's great i can still focus on the podcast while playing!!)",0,
Very relaxing and worth every penny.,1,relaxing
Very very calming and a good calm break from murdering people,1,relaxing

"If you want to, you can learn the rules of creating various structures (of which there aren't many) and create big elaborate builds (have a look at the community screenshots, these folks know what they are doing!)",0,

"Fun game concept, unfortunately, it has a lot of bugs and is generally quite broken.",-1,bugs
"It has the tells of a unity game that doesn't have a strong back end; a lot of the buildings can't be accessed by villagers, some need access from multiple angles but don't detail it, food buildings often won't acquire raw resources even if the buildings are put right beside them, villagers will starve even if there is food, and a lot of the maps have random spots that you simple cannot build on despite them not having any sort of obstacle.",-1,bugs

Sound and Soundtrack: Stock.",-1,sound
Everything about the sounds in this game is stock!,-1,sound

"Avoiding all spoilers, I strapped myself in for what many describe as a sublime experience.",0,
"Admittedly, I was a little let down in the beginning, as I had not yet understood the journey that awaited me.",0,
"As I progressed and the story developed, I grew fonder of the game and ultimately felt pride in reaching the summit of Mount Celeste.",0,
"The expression, “the journey is more important than the destination” fits this game to a T. 
Just a fair warning for those interested in the game: Celeste is a precision platformer and is often unforgiving, so be prepared to fail a lot (818 deaths during my first run).",0,
[b][+] Challenging is a very accurate description of the game.,1,balance
"[/b]
Comparable to the likes of Super Meat Boy, Celeste is a 2D platformer that offers little room for mistakes - one hit kills you instantly and sends you back to the beginning of the screen.",1,gameplay
"Thankfully, the respawn/reload times are very short, cushioning the player from the frustrations of frequent deaths.",1,gameplay
"Deaths are (nearly) inevitable but given that the controls are simple and responsive, I never had the impression that the game was unfair; just difficult.",0,
"Furthermore, each level introduces new platforming mechanics that gradually become more demanding as the level progresses.",1,level design
These nuances to your controls/movement add novelty and imbues progression with a sense of mastery.,1,controls
Definitely another great example of a game that is “easy to learn but difficult to master”.,1,balance

Yes, the gameplay is good but the story elevates this game to new heights [i](cause they climb a mountain, get it?)[/i].",1,narrative
"While the story touches on many themes, mental health and personal growth are the centrepiece.",1,narrative

"In fact, the journey was so touching that I felt encouraged to focus on my mental health.",0,
[b][+] I especially loved the last level (Summit) as it combines the best of the story and gameplay.,1,level design
"[/b]
In terms of gameplay, it serves as a challenging summary of your journey up the mountain by featuring the different platforming mechanics in a new setting.",0,
"In terms of story, it marks the first big step to self improvement (physically represented by the summit) and the beginning of a great partnership between M(B)adeline.",0,
Overall just an excellent level.,1,level design
[b][+] Completing the main story is only the tip of the iceberg.,0,

The main game is not very long (~5 hours depending on your skill level) but is sufficiently challenging and long enough for plot development.",1,playtime
"The additional levels, however, are where things get really spicy.",1,level design
Hidden collectables in the form of crystal hearts and B-side cassettes unlock additional levels that are significantly harder than the main levels and were probably designed for precision platforming fanatics.,0,

[1]When starting the game, if my first input is with the keyboard, I wouldn’t be able to get my controller to work.",-1,controls
The only solution I found was to reset the game.,0,
"[strike][2]Using the keyboard at all while playing (alt+tab or shift+tab, for example) often disconnects the controller.",-1,controls
It would often take 30 seconds upon returning to the game for the controller to be functional again.,0,

Neither is a major cause for concern but a fix would be nice.",0,
"[h1]🏅[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1]
[h1]★★★★✬ Excellent (if you enjoy precision platformers)[/h1]
Celeste is a fantastic experience but (likely) only if you fall within the niche of gamers that enjoy precision platformers.",0,
"Even I, who typically loves platformers, sometimes found my patience wavering at times (nothing a little break couldn’t fix).",0,

"The levels are gorgeous, the music is amazing, the sense of emotion is a little overwhelming at times, the gameplay is rewarding, and the characters and even the mountain itself flow seemlessly together into a good story and metaphor.",1,level design
"As a gamer, a writer, a psychology student, and someone who's struggled with her own mental health, I have to say this game is excellent on all accounts.",1,narrative
"The assist mode is a generous inclusion that I fully support, and I may yet use it.",1,accessibility

"Spoiler-y advice [spoiler] With all that being said, there is one bit of advice I'd like to offer to anyone that has completed 100% and wishes to purse the 26 golden berries, please don't get upset with yourself if that kind of content frustrates you.",0,
"Golden berries aren't for everyone, and that's okay.",0,
"Walking away from this game at 176 berries and all hearts is perfectly fine, and is virtually the entirety of the experience of the game.",0,

The game isn't full of special moves.,0,
"You don't have to learn 100 different jump, dodge, levitate mechanics.",0,
It has its few core moves and you have to use them to their full potential instead of learning a new technique every 20 min while you didn't even master the last one.,1,controls
The music/sound is literally on-point and fits the game perfectly.,1,sound
It always changes based on the situation you are in and you can't stress enough how important good music and sound is in a platformer.,0,
"Somehow, this plattformer has a good story.",1,narrative
"Thanks to the modern setting, you can really feel with the main character.",0,
I won't spoiler anything here though.,0,

I am a guy that generally plays his few multiplayer games and generally ignore every singleplayer game I bought because I quickly get frustrated or bored.,0,

"And a platformer, it's solid, but unremarkable, and the platforming segments are going to be the sticking point for a lot of people; fortunately, the game has fantastic accessibility options that not only change the difficulty of platform segments, but provide everything from colorblind support to different fonts.",1,accessibility
"Love the clever, witty dialogue, and the mix of platformer and point and click adventure is surprisingly effective (though I'm sure that's helped by my love of both genres.)",1,narrative

I genuinely found myself laughing out loud at home alone to some lines I'll remember for a long time!,1,humor
"As a quick round off of some other features - the accessibility options are thorough, clearly a step above from their past titles and even most other games on the market.",1,accessibility
"Whilst the humour might be immature in parts (plenty of poo, bum, and penis jokes) it's never distasteful, and sensitive topics are treated with the respect they deserve (a reflection of Ben and Dan's own growth in the past 10 years no doubt) and poke fun at the negative sources of these remarks rather than the subject matter itself (for example - racists and sexists are the butt of the joke).",1,humor
The puzzle design was excellent and the platforming just the right level of difficulty (although this can be tweaked to your liking) and the two styles are blended together seamlessly.,1,puzzles

"Narrative development is weak in some areas, but the densely enveloping atmosphere of Dunwall paired with its impossibly sleek stealth-action gameplay, makes Dishonored a pleasure to play.",-1,narrative
"The very first thing that will grip you as you play is the unique world and amazing atmosphere, the game is set in an industrial steampunk city that resembles victorian London, struck by a mysterious plague.. it's dark, it's gloomy and it's beautiful.",1,atmosphere
"There's a great amount of player choice in this game, whenever you are asked to eliminate key targets there will be multiple paths you can follow, some even non-lethal, you can literally play the entire game without killing anyone.",1,gameplay
"Everything about this game just works; the stealth, the combat, the movement; the games overall mechanics simply work wonderfully with all apsects.",1,gameplay
"The story is outstanding, and the game is designed so that your gameplay paths affect, in some ways, how the game progresses and turns out.",1,narrative
"You can kill everything that moves, be selective in your eliminations, or completely avoid every single thing the game will allow you to avoid: It's entirely up to you.",0,
The atmosphere is just...wow.,1,atmosphere
"When that is added to the graphical achievement, it feels like you've been sucked into a steampunk universe.",1,atmosphere
"More, this game caused me to LIKE the steampunk genre.",0,
"The best thing about this game isn't even all that I've written, it's that the design of the game and its gameplay makes this a really good game, period, not just a good stealth game.",1,gameplay
"Its a game that anyone can, and should, honestly, enjoy.",0,
"That is, after all, what games are for: To be fun and enjoyed.",1,fun
Dishonored nailed it across the board.,0,
"Great art style, Good stealth and combat and many ways to accomplish your objective.",1,atmosphere
I would recommend this game to any fan of the stealth genre.,0,
Characters and bodies in that game look different not because of bad graphics but because of a different art style that is simply very attractive if you ask me.,1,art
The World is greatly designed which has as result to make this whole game a little bit more realistic and enjoyable.,1,world
Textures are sometimes blurry and drawing distances are sadly last gen but that doesnt take anything away from the game.,1,art
The Game is Pretty cheap because its a last gen singeplayer title which is good for guys that want  great games for almost no money!,1,price
"The most noticeable aspect of the game is its art design, which was deftly crafted by one Viktor Antonov, a Bulgarian art director famous for his work on designing City 17 and its outskirts in Half Life 2.",1,atmosphere
The plot is serviceable though predictable.,1,narrative
"The game's graphical muscle won't blow you away if you're used to games like Crysis 3, but the art direction props up the visuals enough to make them astounding in certain areas.",-1,art
"There's an old oil painting feel which permeates the game, and it fits the look and feel of the setting very well.",0,
I get a sense of great design while playing this game.,1,gameplay
"The game also runs exceptionally well on PC, so even if you're not wowed by the visuals and the art design like I am, the technical aspects of the visuals won't hinder you from enjoying the gameplay at all.",1,optimization
"Dishonored is fully adaptable to your style of play, which is refreshing in a game that emphasizes stealth.",1,balance
"In my opinion it's the strongest aspect of the game, which is indicative of the game's greater value considering its already great art direction.",1,atmosphere
"The gameplay seems designed to be freely adaptable so you can move seamlessly between stealth and combat when you're spotted, but it then tells you via the plot that playing stealthily and non-lethally is better.",1,balance
"Overall, this game is a beautiful, immersive experience and it should absolutely be played by anybody who typically enjoys stealth games, or games that offer rich, engrossing settings.",1,atmosphere
The graphics of this game holds up truly even after 10 years of its release.,1,art
The story of the main game is great.,1,narrative
But it is one of the few games whose DLC stories far surpasses the main one.,0,
"Rightfully the Game of the Year for 2012, still holds up nearly a decade later, with only minor issues.",0,
"A wonderful world to explore, a harshly black-and-white morality system, and the stories of two men, Corvo and Daud, and the curative (or destructive) power of conviction.",1,world
"For maximum enjoyment, I recommend two playthroughs, one perfectly pacifist, one gloriously violent - the first to enjoy the clever and flexible level design, the latter to let loose with the equally flexible arsenal of tools made available for the purposes of carnage.",0,
so good i actually bought the game after i pirated it,0,
Take note - this is how to design a game.,0,
"Dishonoured is an immersive sim set in a grimy world, where you get revenge on a cabal of unsavoury rich people.",0,
It's also one of the best designed games I've ever played.,1,gameplay
It gives the player a lot more respect than other games would have the courage to do.,0,
Other games would tell the player most of the necessary information through either lengthly cutscenes or an NPC whispering instructions in your ear of what to do next.,0,
"In Dishonoured, most of this information comes from in-game dialogue between NPCs.",1,narrative
You have to actually listen in to enemy conversations in order to get information about your targets' behaviour and weaknesses.,1,gameplay
This builds immersion: the game rarely needs to take you out of the experience in order to tell its story.,0,
"Of course, you can just ignore the conversations completely - the game won't stop you, and you'll still be able to complete each level just fine.",0,
That's because of the game's fantastic level design.,1,level design
"I turned off objective markers for the entire game and never once got lost or unsure of where to go next (I would encourage all players to play with markers off, it really adds to the immersion and forces you to take in the environment more).",1,accessibility
"The levels themselves are fantastically open, with vertical movement being a core focus.",1,level design
The world is a sandbox playground where every strategy is equally viable.,1,world
The story itself is quite a simple revenge narrative but it's still sufficiently engaging.,1,narrative
"There are some fun characters, some good worldbuilding, and it's mostly told without cutscenes, which is always a plus.",1,world
"It could probably use with more setup before everything goes to hell, and could have been a bit more adventurous, but it allows the player to get immersed in the world and creates some cool narrative moments, which in my eyes is enough.",1,atmosphere
i wish corvo was my dad :(,0,
Probably the best solo game I've played since several years.,0,
"An interesting scenario and multiple opportunities to complete a mission by choosing a different path remaining invisible or killing everyone, you choose.",1,gameplay
"Play Dishonored at maximum difficulty to enjoy the game to its fair value, previous difficulties being too simple.",1,balance
Beautiful story with cool graphics,1,narrative
Stealth and many ways to kill enemies,1,gameplay
It is worth buying and playing even at full price,1,price
"While the plot might not be wholly original, especially to those that immerse themselves equally in literature and film, and containing a plot twist that everyone with a set of eyes and ears should see/hear coming like a freight train from very early on in the game, it is no less enjoyable even if it cribs most of its narrative from far better sources.",1,narrative
"Graphically, Dishonored goes for a painterly look and exploring its streets makes for an incredibly memorable experience.",1,art
"What a perfect example of using really good, well thought through level design, great artstyle and gripping storylines to make a timeless game.",1,gameplay
I have 230Hrs on this game as I write this review and the game is only single player do the math on how good it is.,1,playtime

+ Very high replayability value.,1,gameplay
"It might be old, but its a masterpiece.",0,
"With its vast levels, openness, and its plethora of different ways to play, Dishonored's difficulty comes from what you are trying to achieve, whether that is going for a full no-kill ghost run, or trying to kill everyone in the most creative/skilled way.",1,level design
"The bold stylized artistic design and colorful characters give a dark, stirring, yet beautiful pastel look to a divided world that will change somewhat depending on how many people you kill throughout.",1,atmosphere
"This approach to putting narrative and gameplay together works great, because if you make the choice to go through killing many people, later levels will have more enemies to fight, however if you choose to do the opposite than there will be less and it will be easier to sneak around.",1,gameplay
"Although by this time the second installment is already out, I would highly recommend playing this great game if you haven’t already.",0,
"Dishonored is sort of like a mix of Hitman, Thief, and Deus Ex in equal parts.",0,
"The mission style gives you a target to assassinate and a playground of ways to do it like Hitman, the overall FPSRPG structure is pretty remniscient of Deus Ex, and you're encouraged to steal everything that isn't bolted to the ground like in Thief.",0,
"If you like any of these games you'll probably also like Dishonored, though there are a few catches.",0,
"The first hangup is that the AI is fine when it's left alone, but gets a little schizophrenic once anything out of the ordinary happens.",1,AI
"There is multiple ways to play this game including stealth, or all-out rage.",1,balance
You can have a select number of supernatural abilities to help you throughout the game.,0,

"I played it completely through aobut 5 times, each with slightly different or drastically different gameplay and each different decision made the game different!",1,playtime
"In addition to, good story that adapts to your choices, smart gameplay that allows to take plenty routes and methods to complete a mission plus exceptional artistic design.",1,gameplay
"I love the fact how a game that I skipped in 2012, bought in 2015 and actually played in 2017 ..crawled up to be one my fav games.",0,
"Dishonored was a fun experience that reminds me of Bioshock and Thief in game play, and a decent story with likable characters.",1,fun
"This game has aged really well, with good controls and a well done game design.",1,controls
Dishonored plays and feels a lot like Bioshock.,0,
"There are different powers, a different way to acquire them, and less of them, but if you liked Bioshock, you will most likely enjoy Dishonored.",0,
"Stealth is more important in Dishonored, but at easier difficulties, you can play more forward, as it is forgiving in combat and running away when overwhelmed is quite easy.",0,
"The story is predictable and definitely not the main focus, but still enjoyable and well done.",1,narrative
I liked the way the story is presented and unfolds.,1,narrative
"While I knew what was going to happen at every turn, it was still enjoyable to partake in.",0,
"The dialogue was well done, as was the voice acting.",1,narrative
The level designs is where I think Dishonored shines most.,1,level design
I have no complaints at all about the level design.,1,level design
"I was never stuck in the world, was able to explore many variants of game play on the same map, and never became bored in the main game missions.",1,level design
"While a completely different game, the map approach still reminds me a bit of the Hitman game play, which gives you a choice to play your strengths or weaknesses in approaching a task, giving you freedom of choice on how to complete a mission.",1,world
storyline is interesting and satisfying.,1,narrative
I've been meaning to give this game a try before Dishonored 2 came out.,0,
"When Bethesda announced that for a limited time you could get this game free with a preorder of Dishonored 2, I pounced on the offer.",0,

" The weapons are wildly unbalanced, my level 4 pistol one shot's non-vampire enemies, and 3 shots vampires; you don't even need to use your abilities",-1,balance
"The world is characterful and detailed in most places like you would expect from an Arkane game, like Dishonoured or Deathloop",1,world
Shops and houses are full of items and are believable,1,world
The subtle story being told through the cultish markings and unfortunate victims of the Vampire invasion are true to Arkane's brilliant story telling,1,world
"Enemies die instantly, to a single pistol shot to the head",-1,balance
" Where are all the civilians? Did they all go on holiday prior the the Vampire invasion? You find the odd person to rescue, a few in safe houses, but other than that, they  are clearly all dead or turned into cultists",-1,atmosphere
" Some of the cool new physics are present, but overall, while the game does not look bad, its hardly looks next gen",1,physics
This i think is more to do with the art style,0,
" Arkane has always had a very cool, dystopian art style, with over accentuated, grim, almost caricature like characters",0,
" This is evident in the vampires and player characters design and proportions, but it is much more subtle than something like dishonoured",0,
" The colour palette of the game is similar to their other games with subtle pastel tones, however its like a ""Lite"" version of an Arkane game",1,art
"Sound design is good, with decent music and the voice acting for the most part is enjoyable",1,sound
The characters interact well to each other (I played as Dev the plucky British cryptid hunter),0,
Coop worked fine but you can only host a game then join in,0,
You cannot join mid match and no matchmaking,0,
So thats bare bones,0,
"Bugs, game is buggy as hell",1,bugs
" Enemies that are immortal and cant see you are semi frequent, forcing me to reload the game to fix it",1,balance
" Nice to get close and admire the character models and hear some of their passive dialogue but other than that, annoying",1,bugs
" T-posing characters, jittering in the floor and enemies stuck in floors to name but a few",1,bugs
I really hope they patch it and improve it and don't just abandon it,0,
" At this stage im enjoying it for what it is, but only with the hope that it is improved upon",0,
I cannot recommend buying it now,0,
See if they patch it,0,
"Arkane, I am dissapointed in you",0,
" Let people publicly test your game next time, and remember to test it yourself, because, if you did and didnt see these flaws, then you deserve the negative press you are getting",0,

"Story was very arkane level, not anything amazing but servicable",1,narrative
Performance is pretty bad,-1,optimization
" Beyond its poor performance, which is questionable given its graphical fidelity and AI, the game simply contains so many minor grievances that rapidly add up, pulling me out of the experience",-1,AI
Very clearly unoptimized,-1,optimization

Congrats to the artists and level designers on creating a convincing environment (minus the glitches and technical issues),1,level design
story elements are good and start to hook,1,narrative

-beautiful environment art ruined by poor graphic optimization on a 30 series card,-1,optimization
"-below par story and no immersion from the few npcs that are present (they just stand there and don't do much else, except exist, like in a early access games)",-1,narrative
The world is cool and interesting to explore and tons of stuff to collect and find but no one around,1,world
The guns are in variety and rarity colors but the gun play is nothing exciting and slow,1,gameplay
The AI also kinda just walk right at you or stand still,1,AI
The talent system is cool and character abilities are neat,0,
Different vampire enemies to fight and bosses is cool,0,
Can't really comment on story due to spending hours exploring and doing side missions than main quest lol,0,
The AI: It's clunky as others have said,-1,AI
Don't think I need to go too in depth on this as it's more of something many people have said,0,
Graphics: Beyond pixelation of enemies when tagged some things just pixelate,1,art
World Design: While the world is 'okay' it's empty and kind of bland,-1,world

The story might as well not exist,-1,narrative
The characters are dull and superficial,-1,narrative
The AI is so dumb h***s**t seems like it was created by an intern and don't get me started on the shitty performance whats up with these bad ports 20-60 fps with a 3080 my eyes actually hurt and it feels like imma get a brain aneurysm,-1,AI
the world seems very empty aswell,-1,world
The npcs also have little to no variation and their AI is honestly pretty abysmal,-1,AI
" The story overall was also sorta okay despite having the cop out comic book style ""cutscenes"" from npcs that have little to no depth",1,narrative
£60/$70 for a clearly unfinished game :'(,-1,price

[*] Abundance of food/drink but no idea if it does anything or not,0,
"[*] There are 1 or 2 really nice textures in the game but overall it generally feels pretty dated when wandering around the open world, most of the detail has been put into the restricted number of buildings that you can enter",-1,art
The world and characters are lifeless,-1,world
" The AI also sucks--multiple times I would have enemies stand completely still or shooting at the sky while I unload clips into them, or be unable to hit me because I'm slowly walking backwards",-1,AI
" There is also no incentive for stealth since the ""hardest"" difficulty of the game is still laughably easy thanks to the shitty enemy AI",-1,balance
"There are also numerous other bugs plaguing the game--UI elements not displaying correctly, keybinds disabling themselves, items and notes unable to be interacted with if another player touches them first",-1,bugs

It is an ok game but needs to be better polished and is definitely not worth $70,-1,price
this is at best a $30 game,-1,price
Save your money and buy two cheaper games you will probably have more fun,-1,price
The game itself is buggy,-1,bugs
" Controls randomly stop working, menu elements get stuck on screen",-1,controls
You can't pause when playing singleplayer,-1,accessibility
" Oh and ya the NPCs are stupid to the point that they are hilarious, plus if your gun happens to be somehow weaker than the human enemies, shooting them in the head doesn't kills them straight away, might as well be making all the enemies into vampires, at least that would have made better sense",-1,AI
-What the hell is the story with healing and revive animations? Are they meant to be there? They show up for like 2 seconds every few hours,-1,art
-Not one cinematic that is not a Powerpoint presentation,-1,art
-Where are those cool cinematics that were created prior to game launch????,-1,art
-Lag spikes randomly and texture/level of detail popping IS INSANE,-1,bugs

The game is just empty and uninspired,-1,world
The gameplay and AI is just the biggest let down since cyberpunk,-1,AI
" Enemies are so incredibly stupid and offer no challenge, even on higher difficulty, the pathing and AI awareness is beyond stupid",-1,AI
The world feels empty and just dead due to the lack of any real AI pathing or interesting encounters,-1,world
"Reality: Characters are cool, the dialogue is funny, but the skills are meh, very boring skill trees and skill effects are very poor, synergies are dull",1,narrative

AI is dumb enough I can't believe a studio such as Arkane made it,-1,AI
Human AI? You can stand still and they'll miss from range,-1,AI
The AI needs to polish its behavior,-1,AI
The stealth mode is pretty bad in its mechanics,-1,gameplay
The shotting is also poorly achieved,-1,gameplay
For an open world it feels a bit empty,-1,world
It's not worth the price,-1,price
" This feels like a scam, clunky combat, a story and an idea that seemed interesting but is only half baked, the AI is atrocious as well",-1,gameplay
This is not a 70$ game,-1,price
" Story is dull, nothing I do feels worthwhile",-1,narrative
" not to mention the world is 90% empty, and all of the AI run around like they have 3 sets of their 21st chromosome!",-1,world
One positive is the story,1,narrative
the overall cinematics are not bad,1,art
AI is total sh!t too,-1,AI
" Exploration is interesting, Redfall is a nice town to explore, but this exploration is buried by the combat",1,world

The optimization is just fvcked,-1,optimization
" The only fun I had playing this game was making fun of how bad it was, but that got old soon and I just went back into boredom",-1,fun

The only praise I have towards this game are the cgi cutscenes and the character/monster designs,1,art
" Naoto Oshima's artstyle is vibrant and distinct, and is probably what attracted the majority of people to this game",1,art
" Please do not waste 60 dollars on Balan Wonderworld, there are much better platformers that cost much less",-1,price
"This game is a waste of money, certainly not worth the $60 to $80 they tote for it",-1,price
" The costumes feel clunky and rather pointless in certain situations, I understand  the want for varied costumes and skins but what is the point if some of them aren't even that fun to control, or in some cases are done better in the exact same level",-1,balance
"  The movement in the game is extremely simple, no momentum or anything so the game is fairly linear",-1,controls

The music is also more than serviceable,1,sound
Yuji still has it with the art design for sure but the game design is super weak sadly,-1,gameplay

Quake III Arena had more depth in its story than Balan Wonderworld,-1,narrative
" There is no ground pound, no air dash, no homing attack, no double jump, no spin jump, etc",-1,controls
The level design is also horrendously bad,-1,level design
Every level feels the exact same with the only difference between any of them being a painted-on skin that only serves a cosmetic purpose,-1,level design
But the game design is quite poor and unfun,-1,gameplay

" A window pops up every mission complete, that you have to HOLD DOWN to close, which takes up half your screen and prevents you from using melee",-1,UI

" The humor in many of the NPC dialogues had me chuckling out loud, which is rare for a game these days",1,humor
